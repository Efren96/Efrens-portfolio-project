# Efren's Portfolio

## About Project 

For this weeks project, i had to build my portolio. It had to have my name, a picture, a navigation bar with links "About Me", "Work", and "Contact and each link had to scroll to corresponding section when selected. The "Work" section had to have images of my recent work with links that would take the user to a deployed website exhibiting my work and each image had to grow in size when selected or hovered over.

## Steps I Took To Complete Challenge 

* The first thing i did was create a new repository on GitHub and copy it on to my local machine.


* Then went over the acceptance criteria to make a checklist of the things that needed to be done.

* I started my html file, structuring my page from top to bottom, adding my head, body, and footer then started applying my code accordingly.

* After i felt like i had a good html structure, i started styling with css adding background colors, images etc.

* Once I finished styling with css, i went over the acceptance criteria and made sure i checked everything off the list.

* Finally, once i felt like my portfolio met all the criteria, i pushed it to GitHub.
